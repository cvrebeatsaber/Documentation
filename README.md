## Installation

### Initial Steps

- Download [this zip file](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/587454089470803989/620740577146699797/CVREBeatSaberPlugin.zip)
There are three things inside this zip:

![Zip File](/uploads/00_zip_contents.png "Zip Contents")

- Run [ModAssistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant) (make sure you have the core mods, along with the required mods per [this list](https://tinyurl.com/cvremods))
**NOTE: Make sure you have opened the game at least once before attempting to run ModAssistant, otherwise your mods may not work properly!**

- Extract the zip file to your **base game directory!** This is where your `BeatSaber.exe` is located!
**NOTE: This directory is different depending on your game! Follow the instructions below to see where your Beat Saber is located!**

#### Steam Beat Saber Location

`Beat Saber.exe` is most likely located at: `C:\Program Files (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\`

You can double check this by right clicking on the game in steam and choosing properties --> local files --> browse local files.

#### Oculus Beat Saber Location

`Beat Saber.exe` is most likely located at: `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\`

You can double check this by clicking the menu icon next to Beat Saber in your Oculus Library, and then clicking details.

### Beat Saber Folder

- Your Beat Saber folder should look similar to the following (after you extract the zip file into it):

![Beat Saber Folder](/uploads/03_beatsaber_folder.png "Beat Saber Folder")

There should be a `key` file along with your `Beat Saber.exe`, `RestSharp.dll` should be included within the `Libs` folder, and `CVREBeatSaberPlugin.dll` should be within your `Plugins` folder.

If it doesn't look like this, please skip down the the [FAQ Section below](https://github.com/cvrebeatsaber/Documentation#faq)

You have now installed the mod!

## Signup for a cvrescores account

- Go to [this website](https://cvrescores.herokuapp.com/register) and sign up for an account. It should look like this:

**Make sure you choose your correct school!**

Now, click the `Home` button, it should look like this:

![Dashboard](/uploads/05_cvrescores_dashboard.png "Dashboard")

Open up Beat Saber, play a song with `No Fail` on, when it asks you for your PIN, click `Generate PIN` and type it in!

**YOU MUST USE A NEW PIN FOR EACH SONG, OTHERWISE YOUR SCORE WILL NOT BE SUBMITTED. SEE THE FAQ SECTION BELOW!**

That's it!

## FAQ

Q: My folder doesn't look like it should after I extracted the zip. What did I do wrong?

A: You probably extracted in the incorrect directory. You can also copy over each file/folder from the .zip file into your Beat Saber directory.

Q: When I finished a song in Beat Saber, I was told that I was not validated and that I was missing/had not allowed mods. What should I do?

A: Make sure you _only_ downloaded the mods permitted on [this list](https://tinyurl.com/cvremods). If you have mods that are causing errors, you can navigate to your `Beat Saber\Plugins` directory, and delete the plugins that are causing you issues from there.

Q: When I finished a song, I typed in my PIN and it said `Submitting Score...` and that was all. It never said `Score Successfully Submitted!` What should I do?

A: Make sure you typed in your PIN correctly. If this was an _amazing_ play, and you are upset that you lost it because of a typo in your PIN, you may still be able to recover it! DM Sc2ad#8836 on Discord personally for more details. Keep in mind that not all scores will be recoverable, so make sure that you type your PIN in properly!

Q: I'm certain I typed the PIN in correctly, I had just obtained a new PIN from the website, and just finished a song in `No Fail`, yet I still go the `Submitting Score...` and it eventually went away. Did my score ever upload?

A: No. If this happens and you are _certain_ that you typed in a **new** PIN that you had _just_ gotten from the website, please DM Sc2ad#8836 on Discord. You will need to send your `Logs/CVREBeatSaberPlugin/_latest.txt` from your Beat Saber directory, but your score may be saved.

Q: I am a team captain and I want to remove someone from my team.

A: Please talk to the CVRE admins for specifics on why you want to remove this player, only then will the player be removed.

Q: I am a team captain and I want to change the name of my team.

A: Please DM Sc2ad#8836 on Discord your name and team name.

Q: I forgot my password...

A: DM Sc2ad#8836 on Discord with more information, along with proof that you are who you say you are and you can make a new account. **IF YOU MAKE AN EXTRA ACCOUNT WITHOUT INFORMING ME AHEAD OF TIME, YOU RISK LOSING YOUR SPOT AT DIVISION 1! PLEASE TELL ME BEFORE MAKING ANOTHER ACCOUNT!**

Q: Will this be available on Quest?

A: By this Friday (9/13/19), 5pm PST

In general, please DM Sc2ad#8836 on Discord with any questions, comments, concerns, or more.
