# Quest Documentation

**General warning: The Quest mod is not as stable and much more prone to crashing than the PC mod. All Quest scores are saved to temporary files on `/sdcard/`, if you have any issues with score submission, I WILL ask for those files, please send your latest one to me.**

**ALSO NOTE THAT YOU MUST BE ON 1.13.2 FOR THIS MOD TO WORK! IF YOU HAVE UPDATED YOUR BEAT SABER, DOWNGRADE!**

## Installation

- Download [this zip file](https://github.com/cvrebeatsaber/QuestQualifications/releases/download/v0.2.0/QuestCVREPlugin_v0.2.0.zip) and upload it to BMBF. I will not cover the process of uploading a mod to BMBF in this guide, ask on the BSMG discord if you get stuck.

## Usage

- Go to BeatKhana profile and click `Download QuestID`. [!BK QuestID](/uploads/quest_bkid.png "BK QuestID")
- It will save as a `secret.txt` file, it must be named as such.
- Install the mod through BMBF, run the game once. The game should operate normally, if not, DM Sc2ad#8836.
- After the install, you should see this folder on SideQuest: [!SQ ModData](/uploads/quest_moddata.png "ModData")
- Place your `secret.txt` file in that folder (drag and drop)
- Run the game and play the qualifiers. Resulting scores will be placed in this folder on SideQuest: [!SQ packets](/uploads/quest_scores.png "Resultant Scores")
- DM me the packets from this folder that reflect your best attempts. Note that the song name, score, and your user ID should be listed on the filename.

## FAQ

Q: The mod crashes! What do I do?

A: Tell Sc2ad#8836 AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! If you have a crash and a score you absolutely want to keep, please send me your latest `packet.tmp` file.

Q: I don't see a folder at `/sdcard/ModData/com.beatgames.beatsaber/CVREPlugin/cvre_packets`

A: Play _any_ song, then see if it appears. If not, you may have a broken install, DM Sc2ad#8836.
