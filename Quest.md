# Quest Documentation

**General warning: The Quest mod is not as stable and much more prone to crashing than the PC mod. All Quest scores are saved to temporary files on `/sdcard/`, if you have any issues with score submission, I WILL ask for those files, please send your latest one to me.**

## Installation

- Download [this zip file](https://github.com/cvrebeatsaber/QuestQualifications/releases/download/v0.1.0/QuestCVREPlugin_v0.1.0.zip) and upload it to BMBF. I will not cover the process of uploading a mod to BMBF in this guide, ask on the BSMG discord if you get stuck.

Open up Beat Saber, play a song with `No Fail` on, when it asks you for your PIN, click `Generate PIN` and type it in!

**YOU MUST USE A NEW PIN FOR EACH SONG, OTHERWISE YOUR SCORE WILL NOT BE SUBMITTED. SEE THE FAQ SECTION BELOW!**

## FAQ

Q: The mod crashes! What do I do?

A: Tell Sc2ad#8836 AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! If you have a crash and a score you absolutely want to keep, please send me your latest `packet.tmp` file.

Q: When I finished a song, I typed in my PIN and the keyboard simply reappeared!

A: Go to the website, regenerate a PIN, and try again. If it keeps happening, report the issue to Sc2ad#8836 and cancel out of the keyboard. You score can be saved IF AND ONLY IF you send me your latest packet.tmp after this issue happens.

Q: I am a team captain and I want to remove someone from my team.

A: Please talk to the CVRE admins for specifics on why you want to remove this player, only then will the player be removed.

Q: I am a team captain and I want to change the name of my team.

A: Please DM Sc2ad#8836 on Discord your name and team name.

Q: I forgot my password...

A: DM Sc2ad#8836 on Discord with more information, along with proof that you are who you say you are and you can make a new account. **IF YOU MAKE AN EXTRA ACCOUNT WITHOUT INFORMING ME AHEAD OF TIME, YOU RISK LOSING YOUR SPOT AT DIVISION 1! PLEASE TELL ME BEFORE MAKING ANOTHER ACCOUNT!**
